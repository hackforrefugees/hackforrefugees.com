            Currently there are several millions of people that have been forced to flee from their home countries and become refugees. Sweden is one of the countries that take in most refugees per capita, this year 140-150 thousand refugees are expected to arrive in Sweden. This is a huge increase from previous years, causing major challenges for the organisations trying to help the refugees. Several of these challenges can be solved with IT.

            We just finished our first Hackaton and have dozen of projects that need contributers. Since we believe in open-source-based projects, everything is stored on github.

          <p>We organized a hack on the 5-6 of December in Gothenburg, where we gathered a large group of programmers, designers and other tech people. Together they built many tools that can be helpful for both the refugees and the volunteers.</p>
          <p>
            There is a lot of smart people out there that want to contribute in some way, and a hackaton is a very efficient way
            of connecting these people.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are interested in organizing a Hack for Refugees hackaton in your town, please let us know and we'll help you
            as much as we can.
