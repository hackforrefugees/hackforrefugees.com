          <p>
            Currently there are several millions of people that have been forced to flee from their home countries and become refugees. Sweden is one of the countries that take in most refugees per capita, this year 140-150 thousand refugees are expected to arrive in Sweden. This is a huge increase from previous years, causing major challenges for the organisations trying to help the refugees. Several of these challenges can be solved with IT.

          <p>On the 5-6 of December we are organizing Hack for Refugees, where we will gather a large group of programmers, designers and other tech people. Together we will try to build as many tools as possible that could be helpful for both the refugees and the volunteers.</p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to increase the awareness of the problems the refugees face and find new ways for people to help.

          <h2 class="faq__text__header">When can we start hacking?</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever you want! If you want to get going right away, just send us a message  and tell us what you want to work on so we can make sure no teams build the same solution. But the actual hack starts at Burt on Saturday the 5th of December at 09:00. You can keep hacking there until 19:00 on Sunday the 6th, when you’ll get to show off what you’ve done!

          <h2 class="faq__text__header">Will there be food?</h2>
          <p>
            Hell’s yeah. Breakfast, lunch and dinner both days!
            
          </p>
          <h2 class="faq__text__header">I don’t know what to hack on!</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t worry! Just bring a towel and have a look at the cases section.
            
          </p>
          <h2 class="faq__text__header">We want to hack as a team, is that possible?</h2>
          <p>It is! Either have the teammates enter the same team name when registering, or just show up and sit next to each other on hack day :)</p>
          <h2 class="faq__text__header">Will there be prizes?</h2>
          <p>Karma. Loads. And possible something more tangible as well.</p>
